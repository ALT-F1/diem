initSidebarItems({"struct":[["BitVec","BitVec represents a bit vector that supports 4 operations: 1. Marking a position as set. 2. Checking if a position is set. 3. Count set bits. 4. Get the index of the last set bit. Internally, it stores a vector of u8's (as Vec). * The first 8 positions of the bit vector are encoded in the first element of the vector, the   next 8 are encoded in the second element, and so on. * Bits are read from left to right. For instance, in the following bitvec   [0b0001_0000, 0b0000_0000, 0b0000_0000, 0b0000_0001], the 3rd and 31st positions are set. * Each bit of a u8 is set to 1 if the position is set and to 0 if it's not. * We only allow setting positions upto u8::MAX. As a result, the size of the inner vector is   limited to 32 (= 256 / 8). * Once a bit has been set, it cannot be unset. As a result, the inner vector cannot shrink. * The positions can be set in any order. * A position can set more than once -- it remains set after the first time."]]});
